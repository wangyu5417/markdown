## 第一章 英文用法的基本规则

### 规则一 单数名词加 's，构成名词所有格

- 名词结尾是辅音字母时，使用本规则。

	例句：Charles's friend | Burns's poems | the witch's malice

### 规则二 在三个以上的词并列时，除了最后一个词外，其他词用逗号隔开

- 例句：red, white, and blue | honest, energetic, but headstrong | He opened the letter, read it, and made a note of its contents.

- 公司名称中，最后一个逗号要省略。

	例句：Brown, Shipley and Company

- 在缩略词 etc. 前即使只有一个词，也要加逗号。

### 规则三 逗号之间放插入句

- 例句：The best way to see a country, unless you are pressed for time, is to travel on foot.

- 以where和when引导的非限定性关系从句，也要用逗号隔开。

  例句：In 1769, when Napoleon was born, Corsica had but recently been acquired by France.

  ​	   Nether Stowey, where Coleridge wrote *The Rime of the Ancient Mariner*, is a few miles from Bridgewater.

- 限定性关系从句不能用逗号隔开。

  例句：The candidate who best meets these requirements will obtain the place.

- 如果插入语前使用连词，则将第一个逗号放在该连词之前。

  例句：He saw us coming, and unaware that we had learned of his treachery, greeted us with a smile.

### 规则四 在and或but前加逗号，引导一个独立从句

- 例句:The early records of the city have disappeared, and the story of its first years can no longer be reconstructed.	

	​	The situation is perilous, but there is still one chance of escape.

- and 是连接效果最弱的连接词，它用在两个独立句之间，仅仅表示这两个句子存在某种联系，但未限定。改写：

	例句：As the early records of the city have disappeared, the story of its first years can no longer be reconstructed.

	​	Although the situation is perilous, there is still one chance of escape.

- 或者从句可以由短语替换

	例句：Owing to the disappearance of the early records of the city, the story of its years can no longer be reconstructed.

	​	In this perilous situation, there is still one chance of escape.

- 如果一个独立从句或者一个介绍性的短语需要被逗号隔开，并在第二个独立从句之前，在连词之后就不需要用逗号

	例句：The situation is perilous, but if we are prepared to act promptly, there is still one chance of escape.

### 规则五 不要用逗号连接独立从句

- 如果想把语法上意思完整、且不用连词连接的两个或两个以上的从句，组成一个并列句，正确的标点符号应该是分号。

	例句：Stevenson's romances are entertaining; they are full of exciting adventures.

	​	  It is nearly half past five; we cannot reach town before dark.

- 注意，如果第二个从句之前是一个副词，如 accordingly, besides, so, then, therefore或是 thus，而不是连词，仍然使用分号。例句：I had never been in the place before; so I had difficulty in finding my way about.

- 总之，在写作中，最好避免像上面那样使用 so；因为其危险性在于，作者很可能频繁使用 so。一个简单而且通常很管用的方法是不用 so，而在第一个从句的句首用 as。例句：As I had never been in the place before, I had difficulty in finding my way about.

### 规则六 不要将句子断成两部分

- 例句：I met them on a Cunard liner several years ago. Coming home from Liverpool to New York.
- 可以使用相应的标点符号，使重点词、短语得以强调，为表达句意服务。例句：Again and again he called out. Noreply.

### 规则七 放在句首的分词短语必须同句子的语法主语相一致

- 例句：Walking slowly down the road, he saw a woman accompanied by two children.
- 当分词前面连词、介词、同位语名词、形容词和形容词短语，且一起置于句首，上述原则同样适用。例句：On arriving in Chicago, his friends met him at the station.

### 规则八 根据单词的拼写和发音，在一行的末尾将单词断开分行



## 第二章 英文写作的基本规则

### 规则九 使段落成为文章的单元：一个段落只表达一个主题

- 一个题目通常要求分为几个主题，而且每一段表达一个主题。在每段的开头向读者发出了一个信号，即主题又向前发展了一步。
- 通常，单句不能按照段落来写。过渡句是个例外。将过渡句写成段落，表明了一个说明或论点的各个部分之间的衔接。
- 在对话中，每一次发言，即使只是一个单词，也是一个段落；也就是说，每次变换发言人，即为一个新段落的开始。

### 规则十 通常，在每一段落开始要点题；在段落结尾要扣题

- 推荐的方法是要使读者在开始阅读每一段落时，就可以发现每段的目的是什么，在读完以后，仍然记得。通常最有用的段落方式，有以下几种：
  - 段落伊始要开门见山点明中心思想；
  - 随后的句子对表述主题的句子进行解释、举证或扩展；
  - 最后的句子或者强调段落开头的主题，或者总结一些重要的结果。
- 要避免出现结尾跑题或以无关大局的细枝末节结束整个段落
- 例句：
  - 1. Now, to be properly enjoyed, a walking tour should be gone upon alone. ***(Topic sentence)***

    2. If you go in a company, or even in pairs, it is no longer a walking tour in anything but name; it is something else and more in the nature of picnic. ***(The meaning made clearer by denial of the contrary.)***

    3. A walking tour should be gone upon alone, because freedom is of the essence; because you should be able to stop and go on, and follow this way or that, as the freak takes you; and because you must have your own pace, and neither trot alongside a champion walker, nor mince in time with a girl. ***(The topic sentence repeated, in a bridged form, and supported by three reasons; the meaning of the third "you must have your own pace" made clearer by denying the converse.)***

    4. And you must be open to all impressions and let your thoughts take color from what you see. ***(A fourth reason, stated in two forms)***

    5. You should be as a pipe for any wind to play up-on. ***(The same reason, stated in still another form)***

    6. "I cannot see the wit," says Hazlitt, "of walking and talking at the same time."

    7. "When I am in the country, I wish to vegetate like the country," which is the gist of all that can be said upon the matter. ***(The same reason as stated by Hazlitt)***

    8. There should be no cackle of voices at your elbow, to jar on the meditative silence of the morning. ***(Repetition, in paraphrase, of the quotation from Hazlitt.)***

    9. And so long as a man is reasoning he cannot surrender himself to that fine intoxication that comes of much motion in the open air, that begins in a sort of dazzle and sluggishness of the brain, and ends in a peace that passes comprehension. ***(Final statement of the fourth reason, in language amplified and heightened to form a strong conclusion.)***

    	​														——*Stevenson, Walking Tours*

### 规则十一 使用主动语态

- 主动语态通常比被动语态更直接、更有力。例句：I shall always remember my first visit to Boston. 这个句子比下面的表达要好。My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me. 第第一个句子相比，后一个句子既不干脆，也不简练。
- 并不是要作者完全摒弃被动语态，有时还是很方便的。例句：The dramatists of the Restoration are little esteemed today.
- 在文章中习惯使用主动语态会写出说服力非常强的文章。通过使用一个主动语态及物动词来取代一些肤浅的表达像there is，或could be heard，可以使一个平淡乏味的描述句或表达变得生动。例句：There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground. 改为：Dead leaves covered the ground.
- 通常，要避免使一个被动句直接依赖于另一个被动句。例句：Gold was not allowed to be exported. 改为：It was forbidden to export gold.
- 常犯的错误是用名词来表达行为动作，使动词除了完成句子之外，不再起任何作用。例句：A survey of this region was made in 1900. 改为：This region was surveyed in 1900.

### 规则十二 陈述句中使用肯定说法

- 避免使用乏味的、死气沉沉、犹犹豫豫、模棱两可的语言。使用not来表达否定或不同的观点，绝不要使用含糊其辞的表达方式。例句：He was not very often on time. 改为：He usually came late.
- 不管有意无意，读者决不满足于被告之不是什么；他希望被告之是什么。例句：not honest → dishonest; not important → trifling; did not remember → forgot; did not pay any attention to → ignored; did not have much confidence in → distrusted
- 否定之否定和肯定形式都是有力的表达方式。例句：Not charity, but simple justice.  Not that I loved Caesar less, but Rome the more.
- 不用not的否定词通常是强有力的表达方式。例句：The sun never sets upon the British flag.
