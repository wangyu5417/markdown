## Abstract

**Objective**  To identify the risk factors and outcomes associated with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii bloodstream infection (CRAB-BSI). **Methods**  A case-control study was conducted to retrospectively analyze patients with CRAB-BSI in a tertiary care university hospital from January 2013 to December 2017. The age, hospitalization date, and department of the case group patients were selected as the match criteria. 1-2 patients without AB-BSI were randomly selected to remain as the control group. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed after adjusting for patients' underlying diseases to investigate the risk factors of CRAB-BSI. The 30-day post-infection mortality was used as the endpoint of the evaluation. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model were used to analyze risk factors for prognosis. **Results**  67 CRAB-BSI patients and 129 patients with organisms other than CRAB-BSI were included in this study. Multivariate logistic regression analysis implicated that previous use of carbapenem antibiotics [OR 8.79; 95% CI 2.35-32.85; P=0.001], surgery [OR 2.89; 95%CI 1.29-6.50; P=0.010], indwelling nasogastric tube [OR 4.32; 95%CI 1.38-13.52; P=0.012] and CRAB was isolated from other sites before bloodstream infection [OR 2.18; 95%CI 1.03-4.60; P=0.041] as independent risk factors associated with CRAB-BSI. 58 patients with CRAB-BSI were included in the prognostic analysis. 30-day all-cause mortality was 60.3% after infection. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis showed that Pitt Bacteremia score >2 [hazard ratio (HR) 2.66; 95% CI 1.22-5.77; P=0.014] was an independent risk factor for the prognosis of CRAB-BSI, appropriate therapy within 5 days after infection [HR 0.23; 95% CI 0.11-0.48; P<0.001] was a protective factor for the prognosis of CRAB-BSI. **Conclusions**  CRAB-BSI in hospitalized patients is associated with previous use of carbapenem antimicrobial agents, indwelling nasogastric tube, surgery, and CRAB was isolated from other sites before bloodstream infection. Patients with Pitt bacteremia score >2 have a poor prognosis, high mortality. Timely application of appropriate antimicrobial therapy is critical.

## Materials and methods

### Study setting

The study was conducted in the Peking University Third Hospital. The hospital is a 1,700-bed tertiary-care teaching hospital, with approximately  100,000 hospital admissions per year. During the research period, over 25,000 sets of blood culture bottle were sent to the laboratory. The isolation rate of *Acinetobacter baumannii* was 0.37% (93 isolates),  were second only to *Escherichia coli* and *Klebsiella pneumoniae* in the Gram-negative bacteria. 76 isolates was carbapenem-resistant *Acinetobacter baumannii* (81.7%).

### Study design and participants

A case-control study was conducted to assess the risk factors for the acquisition of CRAB-BSI. From January 2013 to December 2017, all adults (≥18 years) hospitalized with suspected infections constituted the initial study cohort. Exclusion criteria: missing key data, CRAB-BSI occurred within 48 hours of admission. Inclusion criteria: the case group consisted of patients were *Acinetobacter baumannii* bloodstream infection, and the drug susceptibility test results were resistant to meropenem or imipenem; the control group consisted of patients without *A.baumannii* bloodstream infection, 1-2 patients were randomly selected  in the same ward during the same time period (within 1 month), and close to age (within 5 years)  as controls.

A retrospective cohort study was performed to assess the risk factors for CRAB-BSI clinical outcomes. The time of follow-up began from the day of bloodstream infection to day 30 after infection. The case group in the case-control study constituted the initial study cohort. Exclusion criteria: missing key data, death sooner than 24 h after the index date, and discharging within 30 days of infection, so that prognosis was unpredictable.

### Data collection and definition

The medical records of the subjects were collected from the hospital electronic medical record system. A blind method was used to collect the epidemiological and clinical data, including demographic (gender and age), stay in the hospital within 90 days before this hospitalization, underlying diseases (malignancy, neurologic disease, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, pulmonary disease, renal disease, peptic ulcer, diabetes mellitus), APACHE II score (only patient in ICU), invasive procedures (central venous catheter, invasive mechanical ventilation, urethral catheter, nasogastric tube, arterial cannula), surgery, ICU stay, use of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants, use of antibiotics (β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, cephalosporins, carbapenems, cephalosins, quinolones, aminoglycosides, glycopeptides, tetracyclines, macrolides, lincomycins, linezolid, metronidazole, sulfonamides Mexazole, antifungal drug)  and the number of antibiotics groups, CRAB isolated from other sites (before the onset of bloodstream infection after admission), blood culture positive alarm time, Pitt bacteremia score, early appropriate therapy (started in ≤ 2 days after infection), appropriate therapy (started in ≤ 5 days after infection) and combination therapy.

​	Observation time in the case-control study: the case group was from the time of admission to the first bloodstream infection, and the control group was from admission to discharge. Observation time in the retrospective cohort study: the starting point was the occurrence of bloodstream infection. The end point of the evaluation was 30 days after infection.

Diagnostic criteria for bloodstream infection: refer to the “*Diagnostic Standards for Nosocomial Infections*” published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China in 2001.

(1) Clinical diagnosis
​	Fever > 38 ° C or hypothermia < 36 ° C, may be accompanied by chills, and merge one of the following:

 	1. There are invasion portals or migratory lesions.
 	2. There are obvious symptoms of systemic poisoning without obvious infection.
 	3. There are rashes or bleeding points, hepatosplenomegaly, blood neutrophils and nuclear left shift, and there is no other reason to explain.
 	4. Systolic pressure is less than 12 kPa (90mmHg), or more than 5.31 kPa (40mmHg) lower than the original systolic pressure.

(2) Pathogen diagnosis
​	*Acinetobacter baumannii* are isolated from blood culture one or more times.

### Microbiologic methods

Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed in the clinical microbiology laboratory using the Vitek 2 automated system (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France). The operation and results were confirmed strictly according to Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI).

### Statistical analysis

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to analysis the risk factors of CRAB-BSI, and univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to analyze the risk factors for prognosis. To assess the impact of exposure of various factors on CRAB-BSI during observation and limit other confounding factors, a propensity score for the risk of contracting CRAB-BSI was calculated based on the patient's baseline [7; 8], including demographic characteristics and underlying diseases. We used this score in subsequent models to adjust for potential confounding. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to calculate the propensity score as the predicted probability of infection for each patient. In the adjusted univariate regression analysis, all ariables with a P < 0.1, along with variables of potential clinical importance,  were then included in a multivariate logistic regression model with propensity scores. After testing the proportional risk hypothesis, the P < 0.2 variables in the univariate Cox regression analysis was included in the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model to analysis independent risk factors for CRAB-BSI prognosis. Multi-collinearity diagnosis was performed using tolerance and variance inflation factor. All possible interaction terms in Logistic regression analysis were examined by adding them, one at a time, and testing their statistical significance in the multivariate analysis model, and using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test the goodness of fit of the model. We selected the best model according to the AIC test.
​	All analyses were performed using SAS (University Edition) and R (version 3.4.4) software.

## Results

### Study population

93 patients with *Acinetobacter baumannii* bloodstream infection were identified during the study period, of which 17 patients were carbapenem sensitive or mediated infection with *Acinetobacter baumannii*, 76 patients were CRAB-BSI, and 9 patients were excluded. A total of 67 patients with CRAB-BSI were included in the case group, and 129 patients without *Acinetobacter baumannii* bloodstream infection were included in the control group. A total of 58 patients with CRAB-BSI who were included in the cohort study (Figure. 1).

### Risk factors for CRAB-BSI

The main characteristics of the case group and the control group before the start of observation were shown in Table 1. The variables with P < 0.3 and other clinically important variables in the univariate logistic regression analysis were included in the multivariate logistic regression model to obtain a propensity score for predicting the probability of infection before admission. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test indicated that the fit of the model to the data was adequate [χ^2^(8) = 7.50; P = 0.484].

​	The risk factors for CRAB-BSI were shown in Table 2. The univariate analysis (adjusted for propensity score) showed that the indwelling central venous catheter [odds ratio (OR) 1.87; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-3.48; P = 0.050], indwelling nasogastric tube [OR 7.05; 95% CI 2.51-19.77; P < 0.001], CRAB was isolated from other sites before bloodstream infection [OR 2.78; 95% CI 1.44-5.34; P = 0.002], In addition, the probability of patients who received antibiotics prior to a positive culture was higher than that of the control group, including carbapenems [OR 6.02; 95% CI 2.56-15.02; P < 0.001], vancomycins [OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.05-3.67; P = 0.034], the use of antibiotics > 2 types [OR 3.14; 95% CI 1.43-6.88; P=0.004].

​	Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed on variables with P<0.1 after adjusting propensity scores, and the variables were included in the model: indwelling nasogastric tube, surgery, CRAB was isolated from other sites before bloodstream infection, using carbapenem and the use of  antibiotics >2 types. The results showed (Table 3), indwelling nasogastric tube [OR 4.08; 95% CI 1.31-12.70; P=0.015], surgery [OR 2.36; 95% CI 1.10-5.07; P=0.028], CRAB was isolated from other sites before bloodstream infection [OR 2.18; 95% CI 1.03-4.60; P=0.041], and carbapenems were used before infection [OR 8.79; 95% CI 2.35-32.85; P=0.001] were associated with CRAB-BSI. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test showed that the model fits the data well [χ^2^(8) = 9.53; P = 0.30].

### Outcomes for CRAB-BSI

​	Patients with CRAB-BSI had a mortality rate of 60.3% within 30 days after infection. The risk factors for outcome of CRAB-BSI are shown in Table 4. Univariate analysis showed Pitt bacteremia score > 2 [HR 2.20; 95% CI 1.05-4.61; P=0.036], effective antibiotics within 5 days after infection [HR 0.23; 95% CI 0.11-0.46; P < 0.001] were associated with CRAB-BSI. Variables with P < 0.2 and other clinically important variables in the univariate analysis were selected for multivariate Cox regression analysis. The variables in the model included: neurological disease, Pitt bacteremia score > 2, effective antibiotics within 5 days after infection. The results showed (Table 4), Pitt bacteremia score > 2 [hazard ratio (HR) 2.66; 95% CI 1.22-5.77; P=0.014] was an independent risk factor for in-hospital death in CRAB-BSI, and effective antibiotic treatment within 5 days after infection [HR 0.23; 95% CI 0.11-0.48; P < 0.001] was  a protective factor for in-hospital death in CRAB-BSI.
