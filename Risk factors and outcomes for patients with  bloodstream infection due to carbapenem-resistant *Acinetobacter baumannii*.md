# Risk factors and outcomes for patients with  bloodstream infection due to carbapenem-resistant *Acinetobacter baumannii*

## Abstract

**Objective**  To identify the risk factors and outcomes associated with carbapenem-resistant *Acinetobacter baumannii* bloodstream infection (CRAB-BSI). **Methods**  A case-control study was conducted to retrospectively analyze patients with CRAB-BSI in a tertiary care university hospital from January 2013 to December 2017. The age, hospitalization date, and department of the case group patients were selected as the match criteria. 1-2 patients without AB-BSI were randomly selected to remain as the control group. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed after adjusting for patients' underlying diseases to investigate the risk factors of CRAB-BSI. The 30-day post-infection mortality was used as the endpoint of the evaluation. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model were used to analyze risk factors for prognosis. **Results**  67 CRAB-BSI patients and 129 patients with organisms other than CRAB-BSI were included in this study. Multivariate logistic regression analysis implicated that previous use of carbapenem antibiotics [OR 8.79; 95% CI 2.35-32.85; P=0.001], surgery [OR 2.89; 95%CI 1.29-6.50; P=0.010], indwelling nasogastric tube [OR 4.32; 95%CI 1.38-13.52; P=0.012] and CRAB was isolated from other sites before bloodstream infection [OR 2.18; 95%CI 1.03-4.60; P=0.041] as independent risk factors associated with CRAB-BSI. 58 patients with CRAB-BSI were included in the prognostic analysis. 30-day all-cause mortality was 60.3% after infection. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis showed that Pitt Bacteremia score >2 [hazard ratio (HR) 2.66; 95% CI 1.22-5.77; P=0.014] was an independent risk factor for the prognosis of CRAB-BSI, appropriate therapy within 5 days after infection [HR 0.23; 95% CI 0.11-0.48; P<0.001] was a protective factor for the prognosis of CRAB-BSI. **Conclusions**  CRAB-BSI in hospitalized patients is associated with previous use of carbapenem antimicrobial agents, indwelling nasogastric tube, surgery, and CRAB was isolated from other sites before bloodstream infection. Patients with Pitt bacteremia score >2 have a poor prognosis, high mortality. Timely application of appropriate antimicrobial therapy is critical. 

## Materials and methods

### Study setting

The study was conducted in the Peking University Third Hospital. The hospital is a 1,700-bed tertiary-care teaching hospital, with approximately  100,000 admissions annually. During the research period, over 25,000 sets of blood culture bottles were sent to the laboratory. The isolation rate of *Acinetobacter baumannii* was 0.37% (93 isolates),  was inferior only to *Escherichia coli* and *Klebsiella pneumoniae* in the Gram-negative bacteria. 76 isolates were carbapenem-resistant *Acinetobacter baumannii* (81.7%).

### Study design and patients

A case-control study was conducted to assess the risk factors for the acquisition of CRAB-BSI. From January 2013 to December 2017, all adults (≥18 years) hospitalized with suspected infections constituted the initial study cohort. Exclusion criteria: missing key data, CRAB-BSI occurred within 48 hours of admission. Inclusion criteria: the case group consisted of patients were *Acinetobacter baumannii* bloodstream infection, and the drug susceptibility tests were resistant to meropenem or imipenem; the control group consisted of patients without *A.baumannii* bloodstream infection, 1 or 2 patients were randomly selected  in the same ward during the same time period (within 1 month), and closing to age (within 5 years)  as controls.

​	A retrospective cohort study was performed to assess the risk factors for CRAB-BSI clinical outcomes. The time of follow-up began from the day of bloodstream infection to day 30 after infection. The case group in the case-control study constituted the initial study cohort. Exclusion criteria: missing key data, death sooner than 24 h after the index date, and discharging within 30 days of infection, so that prognosis was unpredictable.

### Data collection and definition

Risk factor data were ascertained through review of medical records. A blind method was used to collect the epidemiological and clinical data, including demographic (gender and age), stay in the ward within 90 days before this hospitalization, underlying diseases (malignancy, neurologic disease, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, pulmonary disease, renal disease, peptic ulcer, diabetes mellitus), APACHE II score (only patient in ICU), invasive procedures (central venous catheter, invasive mechanical ventilation, urethral catheter, nasogastric tube, arterial cannula), surgery, ICU stay, receipt of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants, receipt of antibiotics (β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, cephalosporins, carbapenems, cephalosins, quinolones, aminoglycosides, glycopeptides, tetracyclines, macrolides, lincomycins, linezolid, metronidazole, Sulfamethoxazole, antifungal drug)  and the number of antibiotics groups, CRAB isolated from other sites (before bloodstream infection after admission), blood culture positive alarm time, Pitt bacteremia score, early appropriate therapy (start in ≤ 2 days after infection), appropriate therapy (start in ≤ 5 days after infection) and combination therapy.

​	Observation time in the case-control study: the case group was from the time of admission to the first bloodstream infection, and the control group was from admission to discharge. Observation time in the retrospective cohort study: the starting point was the occurrence of bloodstream infection. The end point of the evaluation was 30 days after infection.

​	Diagnostic criteria for bloodstream infection: refer to the “*Diagnostic Standards for Nosocomial Infections*” published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China in 2001.

(1) Clinical diagnosis
​	Fever > 38 ° C or hypothermia < 36 ° C, may be accompanied by chills, and merge one of the following: 
1. There are invasion portals or migratory lesions.
2. There are obvious symptoms of systemic poisoning without obvious infection.
3. There are rashes or bleeding points, hepatosplenomegaly, blood neutrophils and nuclear left shift, and there is no other reason to explain.
4. Systolic pressure is less than 12 kPa (90mmHg), or more than 5.31 kPa (40mmHg) lower than the original systolic pressure. 
(2) Pathogen diagnosis
​	*Acinetobacter baumannii* are isolated from blood culture one or more times.

### Microbiologic methods

Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed in the clinical microbiology laboratory using the Vitek 2 automated system (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France). The operation and results were confirmed strictly according to Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI).

### Statistical analysis

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to analysis the risk factors of CRAB-BSI, and univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to analyze the risk factors for prognosis. To assess the impact of exposure of various factors on CRAB-BSI during observation and limit other confounding factors, a propensity score for the risk of contracting CRAB-BSI was calculated based on the patient's baseline [7; 8], including demographic characteristics and underlying diseases. We used this score in subsequent models to adjust for potential confounding. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to calculate the propensity score as the predicted probability of infection for each patient. In the adjusted univariate regression analysis, all variables with a P < 0.1, along with variables of potential clinical importance,  were then included in a multivariate logistic regression model with propensity scores. After testing the proportional risk hypothesis, the P < 0.2 variables in the univariate Cox regression analysis was included in the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model to analysis independent risk factors for CRAB-BSI prognosis. Multi-collinearity diagnosis was performed using tolerance and variance inflation factor. All possible interaction terms in Logistic regression analysis were examined by adding them, one at a time, and testing their statistical significance in the multivariate analysis model, and using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test the goodness of fit of the model. We selected the best model according to the AIC test.
​	All analyses were performed using R (version 3.4.4) software.

## Results

### Study population

### Risk factors for CRAB-BSI

The main characteristics of the case group and the control group before the start of observation were shown in Table 1. The variables with P < 0.3 and other clinically important variables in the univariate logistic regression analysis were included in the multivariate logistic regression model to obtain a propensity score for predicting the probability of infection before admission. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test indicated that the fit of the model to the data was adequate [χ^2 (8) = 7.50; P = 0.484].

### Outcomes for CRAB-BSI

Patients with CRAB-BSI had a mortality rate of 60.3% within 30 days after infection. The risk factors for outcome of CRAB-BSI were shown in Table 4. Univariate analysis showed Pitt bacteremia score > 2 [HR 2.20; 95% CI 1.05-4.61; P=0.036], effective antibiotics within 5 days after infection [HR 0.23; 95% CI 0.11-0.46; P < 0.001] were associated with CRAB-BSI. Variables with P < 0.2 and other clinically important variables in the univariate analysis were selected for multivariate Cox regression analysis. The variables in the model included: neurological disease, Pitt bacteremia score > 2, effective antibiotics within 5 days after infection. The results showed (Table 4), Pitt bacteremia score > 2 was independently with in-hospital death in CRAB-BSI [hazard ratio (HR) 2.66; 95% CI 1.22-5.77; P=0.014, and effective antibiotic treatment within 5 days after infection was independently associated with a protective effect [HR 0.23; 95% CI 0.11-0.48; P < 0.001].
